## ‚úÖ ALL CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Removed Unverified "70% Fewer Calls" Stat
**File:** index.html, Line 48-61  
**Before:** "70% Fewer phone calls"  
**After:** "24/7 Online booking"  
**Reason:** No data to support this claim

---

### 2. Removed "Hundreds of Groomers" Claim
**File:** index.html, Line 292-300  
**Before:** "Join hundreds of groomers who've ditched..."  
**After:** "Join the groomers who are ditching..."  
**Reason:** Just launching, don't have hundreds of users yet

---

### 3. Removed Fake Testimonials Section
**File:** index.html, Lines 266-287  
**Action:** Completely removed testimonials section  
**Reason:** Sarah M., Mike T., and Jessica L. were fictional  
**Impact:** Better to have no testimonials than fake ones (trust)

---

### 4. Fixed Payout Timing Claims (4 locations)
**Approach:** Changed from "24 hours" to "24-hour available" or "weekly default"

#### Location 1: Hero Stats (Line 48-61)
**Before:** "24hrs Get paid"  
**After:** "24hrs Payouts available"

#### Location 2: Pain Points (Line 99-104)

#### Location 4: Comparison Table (Line 217-223)
**Before:** "‚úÖ 24 hours"  
**After:** "‚úÖ Weekly (24hr available)"

**Reason:** Be honest - weekly is default, 24-hour is optional via Stripe instant

---

### 5. Removed SMS Reference in Pricing Teaser
**File:** index.html, Line 171-177  
**Before:** "SMS, invoices, QuickBooks export, 2 staff seats"  
**After:** "Advanced messaging, invoices, QuickBooks export, 2 staff seats"  
**Reason:** SMS not yet implemented (in-app messaging only)

---

### 6. Added BYO Explanation on First Use
**File:** index.html, Line 175  
**Before:** "0% on your own clients"  
**After:** "0% on BYO (bring-your-own) clients"

**File:** index.html, Line 261  
**Before:** "*Pro plan: 0% on your own clients, 10% on marketplace bookings"  
**After:** "*Pro plan: 0% on BYO (bring-your-own) clients, 10% on marketplace bookings"

**Reason:** First-time visitors don't know what "your own clients" means

---

### 7. Updated Calendly Links (2 locations)
**Before:** `https://calendly.com/scrubby-demo`  
**After:** `https://calendly.com/khyle-scrubby`

**Locations:**
- index.html Line 297 (Final CTA)

**Reason:** Using your personal Calendly for now

---

### 8. Made CTAs Honest About Application Process
**Approach:** Changed "Get Started Free" to "Apply Now" / "Apply to Get Started"

#### index.html Line 30 (Navigation)
**Before:** "Get Started Free"  
**After:** "Apply Now"

**Before:** "Start Free - No Credit Card"

#### pricing.html Line 569-572 (CTA)
**Before:** "Get started free"  
**After:** "Apply to get started"

**Reason:** No signup page exists yet - being honest that it's an application process

### 9. Standardized Navigation Across Pages

**Before:** Home, Features, For Providers, Support, Pricing  
**After:** Home, Features, vs Competitors, Support, Apply Now
