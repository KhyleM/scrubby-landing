- ‚úÖ Success message after submission
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsive
- ‚úÖ Integrated with your existing navigation and footer

---

## üîß SETUP REQUIRED (Choose One Option)

### **Option 1: Formspree (Recommended - Easiest)**

**What it is:** Free service that sends form submissions to your email  
**Cost:** Free for up to 50 submissions/month  
**Setup time:** 2 minutes

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://formspree.io/
2. Sign up with your email (support@scrubby.app)
3. Create a new form
4. Copy your form endpoint (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/xyzabc123`)
5. Open `/apply.html` and find line 253:
   ```html
   <form id="applicationForm" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
   ```
6. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual form ID
7. Done! Test it by submitting the form

**What happens:**
- User fills out form
- Formspree sends you an email with all the details
- User sees success message
- You respond to the applicant via email

---

### **Option 2: Direct Email (Fallback)**

If you don't want to use Formspree, you can make the form send directly to your email (though this is less reliable):

**Edit line 253 in apply.html:**
```html
<form id="applicationForm" action="mailto:support@scrubby.app" method="POST" enctype="text/plain">
```

**Downside:** This opens the user's email client instead of submitting in-browser. Not recommended.

---

### **Option 3: Google Forms (Alternative)**

**Steps:**
1. Create a Google Form with the same fields
2. Get the form's embed URL
3. Replace the entire form section with an iframe to your Google Form

**Downside:** Less branded, but very reliable.

**Required Fields:**
- ‚úÖ Name
- ‚úÖ Business Name
